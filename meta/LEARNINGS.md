## 2025-12-26: Repository Organization

**Context:** Reorganizing GitHub repositories to solve AI hallucination and prepare for job search → employment transition

**Learning:**
Structure isn't just about files—it's about **meaning**. The problem wasn't too many repos or poor folder structure. It was **lack of explicit context** that both humans and AI could understand.

**Key Insights:**
1. **Context-as-Infrastructure** - Rich metadata (CONTEXT.md, CONSTITUTION.md) prevents AI hallucination by making intent explicit
2. **Seasons Over Categories** - Organizing by life phases (job-search-2025, employed-2026) is more meaningful than technical categorization
3. **Archival with Gratitude** - Completed work deserves dignity, not deletion. GRATITUDE.md honors what was learned
4. **Hybrid Approach** - GitHub Organizations for scale + Anthropic principles for meaning = Best of both worlds

**Application:**
- Always create CONTEXT.md when starting new project
- Use status markers (ACTIVE, COMPLETE) for clarity
- Document transitions with gratitude
- Preserve intent, not just code
